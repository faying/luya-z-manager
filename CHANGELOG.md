# Changelog

Each component has its own version ([Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)):
patch = fixes, minor = new features (old settings and APIs still work), major = something
must be migrated or several components have to be updated together.

| Component | What it is | Version from |
|---|---|---|
| `core` | `luyaz-core`, the core service (`:9460`) | `crates/luyaz-core/Cargo.toml` |
| `lweb` | `luyaz-web`, the admin web (`:9090`) | `crates/luyaz-web/Cargo.toml` |
| `sentinel` | `luyaz-sentinel`, screen owner and watchdog | `crates/luyaz-sentinel/Cargo.toml` |
| `touch` | `luyaz-ui`, the touch screen UI | `touch-ui/rs/devui/Cargo.toml` |
| `scripts` | device scripts (doctor, init scripts, …) | `touch-ui/scripts/VERSION` |

Each program prints its version with `--version`, e.g. `luyaz-core 1.0.0 (6e606ec)`.
Entries are written under **Unreleased**, tagged with the component, and move into a
version section when that component is released. `Requires:` lists the minimum versions
of other components.

A Chinese copy is in [CHANGELOG.zh-CN.md](CHANGELOG.zh-CN.md).

## Unreleased

## core 1.0.0, lweb 1.0.0, sentinel 1.0.0, touch 1.0.0, scripts 1.0.0 — 2026-10-17

Baseline: the first numbered versions. Everything up to here (one Cargo workspace, the
Luya-Z names and device layout under `/data/luyaz/`) counts as 1.0.0 for every component.
